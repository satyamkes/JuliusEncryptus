## PS-1: Decrypting the Caesar Cipher

### Problem Statement
> `Can you decrypt intercepted messages encoded with the Caesar Cipher to uncover clues about potential attackers‘ strategies and timelines?`

## Our Idea

Creation of An analysis tool which will provide **potential** solutions to the Caesar cipher provided, which can be readily used on any system with a working internet connection, Hence

<h1 display='block' align='center' align='center'> JULIUS ENCRYPTUS </h1>

<p align = 'center'> 
A project to create an API which returns all possible combinations to a caesar cipher and sort them into recommended ones and non recommended ones to smoothline the vetting process.

We have also created a website to display the API's prowess
